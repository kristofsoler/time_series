# Time Series Prediction of Disease Outbreak Among Farmed Salmon in Norway, using SARIMAX and Exogenous Variables

This project explores predictive modeling techniques for identifying disease outbreaks in farmed salmon within Norway, focusing on time series methods. It contrasts the effectiveness of traditional SARIMAX models with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), emphasizing the integration of exogenous variables and the complexities of capturing non-linear patterns in disease outbreak data.

Dataset

The primary datasets were retrieved from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Norwegian Food Safety Authority, 2024). The API allows selection of the 2 main datasets proposed in this study: Salmon diseases, Salmon lice. The datasets are recorded from 2012 to 2019 with approximately 75000 disease events and the salmon lice dataset has approximately 750000 rows. 2nd dataset (salmon Lice) tracks weekly records of salmon lice infestation levels and environmental conditions across various salmon farms in Norway. This project involved integrating multiple datasets in different formats to create a comprehensive framework for predicting disease outbreaks in farmed salmon. Additionally, geospatial data in formats like GEOjson The data sources ranged from outbreak records in CSV files to environmental metrics stored in structured databases and farm-specific metrics in Excel files. A key challenge was harmonizing these diverse formats and aligning them temporally, as the data were collected at varying frequencies (e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly). Temporal resampling and interpolation were employed to create a unified timeline, while geospatial data were transformed into tabular formats to integrate with time series models. The variability in scales and units across datasets required robust scaling and normalization techniques to ensure consistency. Missing data were addressed using imputation methods, while dimensionality reduction helped manage the high dimensionality introduced by numerous exogenous variables. The resulting integrated dataset enabled the inclusion of critical factors like temperature, lice counts, and farm density into the modelling process, using both SARIMAX and TCN models. This comprehensive data preparation facilitated a deeper exploration of temporal and spatial patterns, ultimately improving the predictive accuracy of disease outbreak models and providing a goodfoundation for model comparison and evaluation.
